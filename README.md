# 🛡️ Prompt Injector

> **Lightweight prompt injection testing for AI security professionals**

A minimal TypeScript library and interactive testing suite for systematically evaluating AI system resilience against prompt injection attacks. Built on cutting-edge research from NeurIPS 2024 and industry-leading security frameworks.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

**AI systems are under constant attack.** With 89.6% success rates against production models, prompt injection vulnerabilities represent one of the most critical security risks facing AI-powered applications today.

- **🔴 Risk**: Unvalidated AI systems can leak sensitive data, execute unauthorized actions, and bypass safety guardrails
- **💰 Impact**: Data breaches, compliance violations, and compromised user trust
- **⚡ Solution**: Proactive security testing with state-of-the-art attack patterns

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔬 Research-Backed Attack Patterns
- **100+ curated injection patterns** from JailbreakBench (NeurIPS 2024)
- **CySecBench integration** - 24x more comprehensive than traditional datasets  
- **Multi-vector testing**: Jailbreaking, instruction hijacking, logic traps, encoding attacks

### ⚙️ Configurable Testing Framework
- **Severity levels**: Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert
- **Attack categories**: Role-play exploits, system prompt overrides, encoding bypasses
- **Custom targeting**: Fine-tune tests for your specific use case

### 🎨 Interactive Tech Demo
- **Svelte 5 + Apple HIG design** - Beautiful, intuitive interface
- **Real-time visualization** of attack patterns and vulnerabilities
- **Educational mode** with detailed explanations of each technique

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
npm install @blueprintlabio/prompt-injector
```

```typescript
import { PromptInjector } from '@blueprintlabio/prompt-injector';

const injector = new PromptInjector({
  severity: 'intermediate',
  categories: ['jailbreak', 'instruction-hijack'],
  maxAttempts: 50
});

// Generate targeted test cases with specific injection goals
const testCases = injector.generateTests('customer-service-bot');

// Test your system
const results = await injector.runTests(yourAISystem);
const report = injector.generateReport(results);

console.log(`Risk Score: ${report.summary.riskScore}`);
console.log(`Success Rate: ${report.summary.successRate}%`);
```
